         <h3> ANCIENT INDIAN VEDIC MATHEMATICS : </h3>
        <p>
          1. In the course of aur di8courses on manifold and 
          multifarious subjects (spiritual, metaphysical, philosophical, 
          psychic, psychological, ethical, educational, scientific, mathematical, historical, political, economic, social etc., etc.,) from 
          time to time and from place to place during the last five decades 
          and more, we have been repeatedly pointing out that the Vedas 
          (the most ancient Indian scriptures, nay, the oldest "Religious" 
          scriptures of the whole world) claim to deal with all branches 
          of learning (spiritual and temporal) and to give the earnest 
          seeker after knowledge all the requisite instructions and guidance 
          in full detail and on scientifically-nay, mathematiqallaccurate lines in them all and so on 
        <br><br> 
        2. The very word "Veda" has this derivational meaning 
          i.e. the fountain-head and illimitable store-house of all knowledge. This derivation, in effect, mcans,condotes and implies that 
          the Vedas should contain within themselves all the knowledge 
          needed by mankind relating not only to the so-called 'spiritual' 
          (or other-worldly) matters but also to those usually described 
          a8 purely "secular", "temporal", or "wordly"; and also to 
          the means required by humanity as such for the achievement 
          of all-round, complete and perfect success in all conceivable 
          directions and that there can be no adjectival or restrictive 
          epithet calculated (or tending) to limit that knowledge down in 
          any sphere, any direction or any respect whatsoever. 
         <br><br>
         भारतीय सभ्यता में गणित का महत्व बहुत प्राचीनकाल से है। वैदिक काल में भारतीय ऋषियों ने अद्भुत गणितीय तकनीकों का अध्ययन किया और 
         उन्होंने इसे वैदिक गणित के रूप में विकसित किया। वैदिक गणित भारतीय पौराणिक साहित्य में उल्लेखित है और इसे 'श्रुति' के रूप में जाना जाता है।
          <br><br>
        वैदिक गणित का उद्भव भारतीय राष्ट्रीय धार्मिक ग्रंथ, वेदों, के साथ संबद्ध है। वेदों में संख्या, संख्या के गुणफल, गणना, और अन्य गणितीय अभ्यासों का विस्तृत वर्णन है। 
        ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद, सामवेद, और अथर्ववेद में गणितीय सिद्धांतों के अनेक सूक्त मिलते हैं जो वैदिक गणित के उत्पत्ति के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं।
          <br><br>
      वैदिक काल में, ऋषियों ने संख्याओं की अद्भुत गुणत्वकी गणना तकनीकों को खोजा और उन्हें विकसित किया। ये तकनीक आसान, तेज,
      और प्रभावी होते थे और लोगों को संख्याओं के साथ गणना करने में मदद करते थे। इन तकनीकों के अनुसार, भारतीय गणितकार संख्याओं
      की गुणा और भाग करने के लिए अद्भुत और सरल सूत्रों का उपयोग करते थे।
          <br><br>
      वैदिक गणित की महत्वपूर्ण विशेषता यह थी कि ये गणितीय तकनीकें और सूत्र अनुवादनीय थीं और लोगों के लिए सरल और समझने में सुविधाजनक थीं।
      <br><br>
      वैदिक गणित के उत्थान के बाद, भारतीय गणितकारों ने इसे आगे बढ़ाया और विकसित किया। इसके प्रभाव को समझकर, आधुनिक गणित और गणितीय 
      अनुसंधान के क्षेत्र में भारतीय वैज्ञानिकों की महत्वपूर्ण योगदान को पहचाना जा सकता है।

        <h3>Overview  </h3>
        <p>
          <br><br>
          1. Origins in Ancient India : <br>
          The mathematical techniques found in Vedic mathematics are believed to have originated in ancient India, possibly as far back as the Vedic period, which spanned roughly from 1500 BCE to 500 BCE. During this time, oral traditions were prevalent, and mathematical knowledge was passed down through generations orally.
          <br><br>
          2. Compilation by Bharati Krishna Tirtha: <br>
          Bharati Krishna Tirtha, who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, is credited with popularizing and systematizing Vedic mathematics. He was the Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of the Govardhan Matha monastery in Puri, India. In the early 20th century, he wrote several books on the subject, including "Vedic Mathematics" (1965), which introduced Vedic mathematical techniques to a wider audience.
          <br><br>
          3. Spread and Influence: <br>
          Bharati Krishna Tirtha's books on Vedic mathematics gained popularity in India and abroad, particularly among those interested in alternative approaches to mathematics education. Some schools and educational institutions began incorporating Vedic mathematical techniques into their curriculum.
          <br><br>
          4. Controversy and Criticism: <br>
          While proponents of Vedic mathematics claim that its techniques offer faster and easier methods for solving mathematical problems, critics argue that many of the techniques are not unique to Vedic mathematics and can be found in other mathematical traditions. Additionally, some scholars question the historical accuracy and authenticity of Vedic mathematics, suggesting that it may have been retroactively attributed to ancient Indian texts.
          <br><br>
          5. Modern Applications: <br>
          Despite the controversy surrounding its historical origins and effectiveness, Vedic mathematics continues to be taught in some schools and is studied by enthusiasts around the world. Some people find value in its emphasis on mental calculation and its alternative approaches to traditional mathematical methods.

          <h3> Aothor </h3>

          <p> The author and compiler of "Vedic Mathematics" is Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha, also known as Bharati Krishna Tirthaji Maharaja. He was born on March 14, 1884, in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India, with the birth name of Venkatraman. He later became a Hindu monk and scholar, eventually rising to the position of Shankaracharya of the Govardhan Matha monastery in Puri, Odisha, one of the four principal monasteries established by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.
              <br><br>
              Early Life and Education: <br>
              Born into a scholarly Brahmin family, Bharati Krishna Tirthaji showed exceptional intelligence from a young age. He received a traditional Indian education in Sanskrit, Vedanta, and other ancient texts. He also excelled in modern academic subjects, including mathematics.
              <br><br>
              Academic and Spiritual Pursuits: <br>
              After completing his traditional education, Bharati Krishna Tirthaji pursued higher studies in mathematics, earning degrees from esteemed institutions in India. He also delved deeply into spiritual practices and Vedantic philosophy, following the path of renunciation.
              <br><br>
              Discovery of Vedic Mathematics: <br>
              During his tenure as the Shankaracharya of Govardhan Matha, Bharati Krishna Tirthaji claimed to have rediscovered ancient mathematical principles and techniques embedded within the Vedas, particularly in the "Sutras" (aphorisms) and other ancient texts. He spent years meticulously deciphering and systematizing these techniques, which he believed were simpler and more efficient than conventional methods of arithmetic and algebra.
              <br><br>
              Authorship: <br>
              In the 20th century, Bharati Krishna Tirthaji authored several books on Vedic mathematics, the most famous being "Vedic Mathematics," published posthumously in 1965. In this seminal work, he presented his findings on the Vedic mathematical techniques, organizing them into a coherent system that could be easily understood and applied by students and enthusiasts.
              <br><br>
              Legacy: <br>
              Bharati Krishna Tirthaji's work on Vedic mathematics sparked widespread interest and debate. While some praised his contributions for providing alternative methods of mathematical calculation and fostering mental agility, others criticized his claims as lacking historical evidence and mathematical rigor. Despite the controversy, his books on Vedic mathematics gained popularity in India and abroad, influencing educational curricula and inspiring further research into ancient Indian mathematics.
              <br><br>
              Later Years and Passing: <br>
              Bharati Krishna Tirthaji spent his later years disseminating his teachings on Vedic mathematics and Vedanta through lectures and writings. He passed away on February 2, 1960, leaving behind a rich legacy of spiritual wisdom and mathematical innovation.
